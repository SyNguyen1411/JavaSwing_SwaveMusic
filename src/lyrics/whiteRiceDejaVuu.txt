Uh, ten, twenty, thirty hours
Head, shower, bed (ayy)
I could lay here with ya 'til the day switch, ooh (ooh)
Love like a shot of Henny, I would chase it
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh (ooh)
You would think it's white rice by the way we spoon (white rice)
Shut the blinds and we sleep 'til noon (night, night)
Better hold tight, might be leaving soon
But can't leave behind the smell of your perfume
Girl, it feels like déjà vu
Will I have your love when I need it, need it? (Déjà vu)
Déjà vu
From the morning light to the evening, evening
You wouldn't mind it if I stayed all night
Girl, you make it hard to say goodbye
Like déjà vu
Familiar feeling
Don't say you're leaving, no
In these four walls, I'll take you all kind of places
You walk around this house in your drawers
But I think you're better off naked, uh, ayy
She wanna ride like an '84 Caprice (yeah, yeah)
You'll be my passenger all between the sheets (all between the sheets, all between the sheets)
You would think it's white rice by the way we spoon (white rice)
Shut the blinds and we sleep 'til noon (night, night)
Better hold tight might be leaving soon
Now, it's just way too quiet when you're not in this room
It feels like déjà vu
Will I have your love when I need it, need it? (Déjà vu)
Déjà vu
From the morning light to the evening, evening
You wouldn't mind it if I stayed all night
Girl, you make it hard to say goodbye
Like déjà vu
Familiar feeling
Don't say you're leaving, no
Don't wake up, let's just keep dreaming
Won't need words to speak your love language
For what it's worth, your time ain't wasted here, oh no (oh no)
(Looks like you found you some peace) don't wake up
(Let's just keep dreaming) (shawty I'm sure, seen it all before, hey)
(Won't need words to speak your love language)
(Looks like you found you some peace)
(Shawty I'm sure, seen it all before)
Feels like
Déjà vu
Will I have your love when I need it, need it?
Déjà vu
From the morning light to the evening, evening
You wouldn't mind it if I stayed all night
Girl, you make it hard to say goodbye
Like déjà vu
Familiar feeling
Don't say you're leaving, no
Looks like you found you some peace
Shawty I'm sure, seen it all before, ayy
Looks like you found you some peace
Shawty I'm sure, seen it all before
Looks like you found you some peace
Shawty I'm sure, seen it all before, ayy
Looks like you found you some peace
Shawty I'm sure, seen it all before
