People living their lives for you on TV
They say they're better than you, and you agree
He says, "Hold my calls from behind those cold brick walls"
Says, "Come here boy, there ain't nothin' for free"
Another doctor's bill, a lawyer's bill
Another cute, cheap thrill
You know you love him
If you put him in your will, but
Who will save your souls?
When it comes to the flowers now
Who will save your souls?
After all those lies that you told, boy
Now, who will save your souls?
If you won't save your own?
We try to hustle 'em, try to bustle 'em
Try to cuss 'em
The cops want someone
To bust down on Orleans Avenue
Another day, another dollar
Another war, another tower
Went up where the homeless had their homes
So we pray to as many different gods
As there are flowers
But we call religion our friend
We're so worried about savin' our souls
Afraid that God will take His toll
That we forget to begin, but
Who will save your souls?
When it comes to the beggars now
Who will save your souls?
After those lies that you told, boy
And who will save your souls?
If you won't save your own?
Some are walkin', some are talkin'
Some are stalkin' their kill
Got Social Security
But it doesn't pay your bills
There are addictions to feed
And there are mouths to pay
So you bargain with the Devil
But you're okay for today
Say that you love them
Take their money and run
And say, "It's been swell, sweetheart
But it was just one of those things"
Those flings, those strings you've got to cut
So get out on the streets, girls, and bust your butts
Who will save your soul?
When it comes with a burden
Who will save your souls?
After all those lies that you told, boy
And who will save your soul?
If you won't save your own?
I tell you about that
Buy your time, just buy your time
