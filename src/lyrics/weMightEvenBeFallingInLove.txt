[Verse 1: Victoria Monét]
Go 'head, act a fool in it
Freestyle with me 'til you find your groove in it
U-Haul 'cause I might let you move in it
'Cause I ain't had nobody hit it like you hit it

[Chorus: Victoria Monét]
And it feels like
I'm gonna know you for the rest of my life
It's safe to say that we might even be falling in love


[Post-Chorus: Victoria Monét]
Ooh, love, love, love
Ooh, love, love, love

[Verse 2: Bryson Tiller]
Go, go, go 'head, act a fool in it
Freestyle with me 'til you find your groove in it
U-Haul you might let me move in it
Said you ain't had nobody hit it like you did

[Chorus: Victoria Monét & Bryson Tiller]
And it feels like
I'm gonna know you for the rest of my life
It's safe to say that we might even be falling in love

[Post-Chorus: Victoria Monét & Bryson Tiller]
Ooh, love, love, love
Ooh, love, love, love
