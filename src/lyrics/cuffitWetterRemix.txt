Baby, make it rain
Don't let go 'til it storms again (Night)
I pray that this will never end
My love, love, cuff it, don't stop
Let me love you to the remix

I feel like fallin' in love (Fallin' in love)
I'm in the mood to fuck somethin' up (Tonight, I'm lovin' somethin' up, baby)
I need some drink in my cup (Drink it up, drink), hey (Drink it up)
I'm in the mood to fuck somethin' up (I'm in the mood, I wanna make love)

I wanna go missin', I need a prescription
I wanna go higher (Sit on top), can I sit on top of you? (Can I sit on top?)

Hypersonic, sex erotic
On my body, boy, you got it (You got it)
Hit them 'draulics while I ride it (Come get it)
Got me actin' hella thotty
So excited, so exotic
I'm a seasoned professional
Squeeze it, don't let it go
Tease it, no self-control
I can see the love in your eyes
Boy, I know you wanna squeeze it, don't lie
Double-tap when I walk by, fuck a reply
You wanna deep dive in it and I know why, full moon, na, na
Assume that it's high tide, baby, just get it in the water with it
Boy, it's waist-high, ain't no need in holdin' back
Stay with it, baby, keep on cuffin'
Right there, baby, keep on bussin', I'm so nasty
Yeah, you (You, you)
Come and cuff it, cuff it, cuff it, cuff it, baby (You)
While I buss it, buss it, buss it for you, baby (You)
Oh, baby (You, you)
Anywhere, anytime, I don't mind, I don't mind

Boy, for you (Boy, for you, for you)
I'm backin' the truck up, huh
Stay with it, baby, keep on cuffin' (Fuck it up)
Right there, baby, keep on bussin' (For you), I'm so nasty
A bitch'll get fucked up, huh (For you, for you)
I'm puttin' my cup up, huh
Stay with it, baby, keep on cuffin' (For you)
Right there, baby, keep on bussin', I'm so nasty

Bet you you'll see stars, bet you you'll go far
Bet you you'll levitate, bet you you'll meet God
