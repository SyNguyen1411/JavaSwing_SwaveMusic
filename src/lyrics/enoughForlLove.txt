Stop so we can talk about it
Tell me, what's goin' on with you, baby?
Let go, even though you doubt it
Tell me, are you keepin' up with your wounds?
Can you love through it, baby?
I don't really know why you walk away
Never really know what you got to say
Are you even there if you have to wait?
And I don't really know why we escalate
And I don't really know why you're testin' me
Yeah, you come around, but you never stay
'Cause you forgot about us
But you're not alone, not alone
Are you tough enough for love? Give it up
But you forgot about us
No, you're not alone, not alone
Are you tough enough for love?
You tough enough? Not enough for love
It's not enough for love
You're enough for love, for love
It's a new day and I know you're tryin'
Lookin' but it's right in front of you, baby
Stayin' on, even through the clowin'
Tell me, are you keepin' up with your wounds?
Can you love through it, baby?
I don't really know why you walked away
Never really know what you got to say
Are you even there if you have to wait?
And I don't really know why we escalate
And I don't really know why you're testin' me
Yeah, you come around, but you never stay
'Cause you forgot about us
You're not alone, not alone
Are you tough enough for love? Give it up
You forgot about us
You're not alone, not alone
Are you tough enough for love?
I need a tougher love
We rode into the night
Get stronger and stronger
I'm holdin' on so tight
But you can't free ride for longer
So don't forget about us
You're not alone, not alone
Are you tough enough for love? Give it up
Don't forget about us
Gotta toughen up for love
I need a tougher love
You're enough for love
