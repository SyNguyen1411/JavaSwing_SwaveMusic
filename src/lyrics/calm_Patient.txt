I'm satisfied with life
I do not just get by, I thrive
What a miracle to be up and alive
Sending love to those who are stuck in the fight
I can not relate to the hate that they made up in their mind
I do not participate because every single time I'm
Down on my luck
Down in the dumps
Down in my darkest hour
You lift me up
You pick me up
You give me so much power
And now I know I'm never alone
It is so easy to see that
It is your love lighting me up
And I know whatever happens, I'll be happy
'Cause I happen to be good in any situation
Calm and patient, by your grace, I'ma be
I'll be singing through the pain
I'ma dance in the rain, I'ma feel it
I'ma always keep the faith
I'ma be okay, 'cause I'm still in it
And it isn't easy, I know it, believe me
It wasn't always this way
Of all of things I have tried out
My favorite is giving thanks and praying
More than a wish, more than I imagine
I manifest by making it happen
There is a gift, even in the madness
And when I'm
Down in the dumps
Down on my luck
Down in my darkest hour (in my darkest hour)
You lift me up
You pick me up
You give me so much power (so much power)
And now I know I'm never alone
It is so easy to see that (it's so easy)
It is your love lighting me up
And I know whatever happens I'll be happy (and I know)
'Cause I happen to be good in any situation
Calm and patient, by your grace, I'ma be
I'll be singing through the pain (I'll be singing through the pain)
I'ma dance in the rain, I'ma feel it
I'ma always keep the faith
I'ma be okay, 'cause I'm still here
'Cause I'm still in it
And I know I owe you all my praise and thanks
And I refuse to lose even one bit of faith
It's the way that you're always showing me
Your grace, oh, your grace
Grace
Calm and patient
Pull me by your grace, yeah and it's-
I like you, I like you, I thank you, I
Thank you, oh
