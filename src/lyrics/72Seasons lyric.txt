Feeding on the wrath of man

Shot down

Traumatic

Time haunted by the past

Long gone

Dogmatic
Although the die is cast
Shot down
Volcanic
But what is done is done and done
Look back
Psychotic
No chance before this life began

Staring into black light
Dominating birthright

Wrath of man
Leaching through
Split in two
Wrath of man
Crash into
Point of view
Wrath of man
Violence
Inheritance
Wrath of man
Thrive upon
Feeding on
72 seasons gone

Feeding on the wrath of man

Shoot back
Erratic
Mad seasons take their toll
New mask
Chaotic
Completely lost control
Shoot back
Fanatic
Wither under looming shadow cast
Slip back
Narcotic
Blinded by the ashes of the past

Staring into black light
Choking on the stage fright

Wrath of man
Leaching through
Split in two
Wrath of man
Crash into
Point of view
Wrath of man
Violence
Inheritance
Wrath of man
Thrive upon
Feeding on
72 seasons gone

Piercing through
Cut in two
Polarize
Point of view
Crash into
Paralyze

Feeding on the wrath of man

Man down
Barbaric
Quick fire machine gun thoughts
Deep seed
Stigmatic
Some have and some have not
Man down
Demonic
No mercy from the ghost within
Turn back
Hypnotic
There's breathing out but not back in

Staring into black light
Permanently midnight

Wrath of man
Leaching through
Split in two
Wrath of man
Crash into
Point of view
Wrath of man
Violence
Inheritance
Wrath of man
Thrive upon
Feeding on
72 seasons gone
