Valentina, baby
I only need one moment of time
To make you feel a way
From the first time I looked in your eyes
I knew that I would find a way
To make you mine
I know it's late, and I know you got a man
Please understand, baby, he won't (baby, he won't)
Love you like I do (like I do)
Give me a break, I know that you want me too (give me a break)
Your loyal is cool, I understand
And I respect it
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, ohh)
Valentina, baby
I only need one moment of time (moment of time)
To make you feel a way
From the first time I looked in your eyes
I knew that I would find a way
To make you mine
