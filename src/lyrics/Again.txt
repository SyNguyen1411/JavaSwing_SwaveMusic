It's getting harder to pretend

The days they start so quick and somehow never end

Finally made it outside

The sun was dressed in red

I just wanna feel something again

There is a garden I must tend

Spend my time just finding tying up my loose ends

Flower growing toward the sun must learn to bend

He just wants to feel something again

And I should've had both my feet back on the ground

Fly up a half of a mile 'fore you push me out

Paint a picture, hang it up there

Watercolor blurs, it's hard to comprehend

By the time it dries, it's not what I intended

Already got so much of myself that I've expended

I just wanna feel something again
