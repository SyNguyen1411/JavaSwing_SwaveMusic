Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
No dick makin' me stupid
No funny Valentine lovin' from Cupid
Need someone to get to it
I see you beggin' so there ain't no choosin'
There must be a glitch in my phone
I'm ready for the switch to turn me on
Won't you come and do something fun to me
'Cause I'm tryna have you
Waste my time, get on my line
'Cause I got the time to waste (ayy)
Use that mouth (ayy), blow this back out (ayy)
Back up every word you say (say sock it to me)
Waste my time, get on my line
Then you can be on your way
Use that mouth, pull a track out (ooh-ooh)
Back up every word you say
Every word (every word)
Every word, every, back up every word
Every word, yeah, yeah
Back up every word you say (ah, ah)
'Cause I'm wide open, sesame
See when you texting me, keep the same energy (oh oh)
Baby, there ain't no rules (ain't no rules)
Way too grown for the bullshit
That triple X on me, we ain't school kids
So come over, and do what it do
'Cause I'm tryna have you
Waste my time, get on my line
'Cause I got the time to waste (ayy)
Use that mouth (ayy), blow this back out (ayy)
Back up every word you say (ooh, sock it to me)
Waste my time, get on my line (sock it to me)
Then you can be on your way
Use that mouth, pull a track out (ooh ooh)
Back up every word you say
Said every word (every word)
Every word, every, back up every word
Every word, yeah, yeah, (oh-ow)
Back up every word you say
Said every word (every word)
Said every word, baby, back up every word
Every word, yeah, yeah (ah ah)
Back up every word you say (ayy-ayy, ayy)
