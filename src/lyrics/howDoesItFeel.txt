Yeah
I gave you more than you wanted
I gave you more than you needed
So tell me, how does it feel
To lose the one you believe in?
I made you drop it on a Tuesday (drop)
I had the popcorn poppin', we made a movie (pop)
So many feelings involved, the way you do me (do)
Tell me, you ready or not? This ain't The Fugees (Fu')
Got one shot to do what it takes (got)
Got no time for no mistakes ('takes)
I save a lot 'cause I'm empty (girl)
It shouldn't hurt me, but I let it
Every time you text me
And by the time I reply, it's too late (late)
Now I feel a way, way, yeah (oh)
And I gave you more
I gave you more than you wanted
I gave you more than you needed
So tell me, how does it feel
To lose the one you believe in?
Yeah
See that's the thing about trust
It's never been about us
'Cause we were doin' too much
We threw the racks out at Follies
Gave you the key where my heart beat
You didn't say it but you said it
It shouldn't have hurt me but I let it
Every time we're alone now
I feel like pain's all of the same
Now I feel a way, oh, whoa
Every time you text me
By the time I reply, it's too late
Something's gettin' in the way
And I gave you more
I gave you more than you wanted
(I gave you more than what you wanted, babe)
I gave you more than you needed (alright)
So tell me, how does it feel (how does it feel, baby?)
To lose the one you believe in?
Bum, bu-bu-bum, bum-bum, bu-bum, bum-bum
Bum, bu-bu-bum, bum-bum, bu-bum, bum-bum
Bum, bu-bu-bum, bum-bum, bu-bum, bum-bum
Bum, bu-bu-bum, bum
