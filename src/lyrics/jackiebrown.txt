Only been a few hours but it felt like days
Only been days but it felt like months
I been gone for a year, only wrote like once.
Life move fast when when you doing what you want.
I guess I'm doing what I want
Hope you doing what you want (what else?)
But What you want? (I don't know)
My new bitch look like Halle Berry
But she don't love me she too scary
My old bitch fine like Jackie Brown
I don't wanna love her, she too down
Will you be my leading lady?
I want a contract girl, no maybe
In the meantime (I guess I'm doing doing what I want)
Get some me-time (hope you doing what you want)
Maybe I don't love myself I don't know.
Leave me here, I'll fuck myself
See me in the mirror I duck myself
I don't need much so fuck my wealth

I Guess I'm doing what I want
(You don't gotta front when life's a water front)
Hope you doing what you want (what else?)
But What you want? (I don't know)
Crib by the beach like Ordell,
No Beaumont, my killas don't tell.
Chateau Marmont, grab the Louis off the shelf
Now my bitch addicted to Chanel.
