Don't stay up too late
But I gotta let you know that you've been on my mind
Taking a while for me to say it, hope it's fine
And I wouldn't mind if you were taking up my time
So I'll meet you at eight
Whatever you wanna do, it's fine by me, I swear
Put on the radio and take you anywhere
'Cause I've been tired of only talking when we text
I hope it's mutual 'cause I think
I could get used to this
Wondering if you think you'd get used to me
Now I'm getting nervous like I used to be
Asking you to say the word and I'll be on the way
(Let's just go talk about it, I got time if you're about it)
If you need me, I'll be here to stay
(Let's just go talk about it, I got time just)
Don't stay up too late
But if you find yourself awake at 2 a.m.
You can call me up, it doesn't matter when
Not gonna lie to you, I'll be here anytime
So let's not complicate
Whatever emotions that we're feeling at this time
When we got issues, we can solve 'em down the line
And if you feel the same, I hope that you won't get tired of me
Do my best to offer something new to you
But you don't need to doubt that I'll be true to you
I promise if you say the word and I'll be on the way
(Let's just go talk about it, I got time if you're about it)
If you need me, I'll be here to stay
(Let's just go talk about it, I got time if you're about it)
Say the word and I'll be on the way
(Let's just go talk about it, I got time if you're about it)
If you need me, I'll be here to stay
(Let's just go talk about it, I got time if you're about it)
Been a while since someone made me feel this way
Been a while since someone made me feel okay
