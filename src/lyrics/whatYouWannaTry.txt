Where we going?
Detroit
Trying get that Mulah
I'm in Detroit with Khadijah
Fighting feelings, rolling weed, yeah
It's organic how we speed through
Midnight moments, foreign vehicles
Fifteen minutes of fame or
Fifteen minutes away from
Finding love in a waveform
Is you someone to wait for?
Is you tryna stay on the ride
Or is you tryna, is you tryna leave the vibe?
Take you to the hotel if you wanna slide
Renaissance drive, baby, make a right
Is you tryna fall for the night
Or is you tryna, is tryna fall for life?
City full of people, you got options right?
Baskin robins, baby, what you wanna try?
What's your flavor?
Tell me, what's your flavor?
What's your flavor?
Tell me, what's your flavor?

I think she want me for my loot
I think she wanna get some food
So thick that body make a man commute
I think she want her
