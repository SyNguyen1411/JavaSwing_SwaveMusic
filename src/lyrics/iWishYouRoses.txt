Ooh, never thought I would be without you
I wish you love, I wish you well
I wish you roses while you can still smell them
With pretty flowers can come the bee sting (Ooh, never thought I would be without you)
But I wish you well, I wish you well
I wish you roses while you can still smell them (Ooh)
I was a rose in the garden of weeds
My petals are soft and silky as my sheets
So do not be afraid to get pricked by the thorns
While I'm here, I'm someone to honor
When I'm gone, I'm someone to mourn
But if you and my heart
Should someday drift apart
I'll make sure to give you these blessings
Because they're all I've got
My love's deep as the ocean
Don't you drown on me
Just know any love I gave you
Is forever yours to keep
Ooh, I wish you roses, and roses, and roses, and roses, and roses
I wish you roses, yeah, roses, roses
Ooh, I wish you roses, and roses, and roses, and roses, and roses
I wish you roses, yeah, roses, roses
Ooh, never thought I would be without you
I wish you love, I wish you well
I wish you roses while you can still smell them
With pretty flowers can come the bee sting (Ooh, never thought I would be without you)
But I wish you well, I wish you well
I wish you roses while you can still smell them (Ooh)
Ooh, I wish you roses, and roses, and roses, and roses, and roses (I wish you roses)
I wish you roses, yeah, roses, roses (I wish you roses)
Ooh, I wish you roses, and roses, and roses, and roses, and roses (Roses, and roses, and roses)
I wish you roses, yeah, roses, roses
You're gonna want me back
You're gonna want me back, you're gonna
You know I can't do that
You know I can't do that, you know it
