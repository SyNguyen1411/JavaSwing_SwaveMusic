Do it like that and I'll repay it
Don't be scared, I ain't afraid
Just like that, come my way
That's my shit, that's my wave
Do it like that and I'll repay it
Don't be scared, I ain't afraid
Just like that, come my way
Yeah
I said, do that, do that, baby, all night long
And I'ma turn off all my phones
You know I hate it when I'm left on read
But he make it all up in the bed
And he take me out, dinin' on nothin' but the best
He got Off-White on right, damn, he can dress
Makin' plans from the East, makin' bands in the West
Rockstar, Black Beatle type, bands on his bread
And baby, I want it, and I'll just be honest
'Cause I just can't front when I look at you
Just keep it one hundred, when I throw these hundreds
I hope that your ass gon' know what to do
Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-that's my shit
That's my wave
Do it like that and I'll repay it
Don't be scared, I ain't afraid
Just like that, come my way
That's my shit, that's my wave
Do it like that and I'll repay it (Huh?)
Don't be scared, I ain't afraid (Wop)

I'm the big boss and I got big bread (Yeah)
I'm gettin' big-headed and I like good head (Shh)
I'm not cheap, baby, and I'm sure not selfish (No)
Shakin' like Elvis, damn near broke my pelvis (Sheesh)
Jumpin' off the top rope, got 'em tag teamin' (Tag)
Putting on a show, I got the whole crowd screamin'
Bougie with the bread, I'll knock a top-notch freak (Freak)
Act like I'm a treat when a dog see me (Rr)
Like a thief in the night, just like she stole my green
Got me walkin' off the scene like a hole in my jeans (Damn, Gucci)
Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-tha-that's my shit
