[Verse 1: Ambré]
I'm on top, I been climbing
Let's trade places, this some real estate
The way we moving things
I won't complain, I won't complain
I won't complain (I won't complain)
Oh, you want me to give you what's yours (Give you what's yours)
That's what it's made for
You don't want to miss the main course (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Ambré]
Tonight I'm finna let you do the honors
But you gotta bless your plate (Plate), save you some for later
No one else switch it up like that, I'm a challenge
I know how to claim my place (Place)


[Chorus: Ambré, Jvck James, Ambré & Jvck James]
But I love it when you call me, "Baby"
Love it when you call me, "Baby"
Love it when you call me, "Baby"
Love it whеn you call me, "Baby"
Turn around, be submissive
Evеn though you know I talk big shit
And I peep shit, I'm attentive
I love it when you call me, "Baby"
I'm baby
Love it when you call me, "Baby"
Love it when you call me, "Baby"
Turn around, be submissive
I, I talk big shit
And I peep shit, I'm attentive (Mm-hmm)
I love it when you call me, "Baby"

[Verse 2: Jvck James]
You been out here
Don't know where you been
I know he been in your ear
What do you see that's so impressive?
No need to take it off if it ain't me in your bed
Ten foot deep in your legs
Yeah, I'm different
No angel but I'm gifted
Won't say it but I'm addicted
Taste looking expensive
I won't be X-ing you out, baby
I'm on that building
They won't be able to tempt me unless you tell me
No-no, no-no

[Bridge: Ambré, Jvck James, Ambré & Jvck James]
You rep me like your hood, I can't escape
Responsibility, I'm sure you know how I feel (You know how I feel)
Cloudy skies open up when you call my name
Whether you mine or not
Tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Ambré, Jvck James, Ambré & Jvck James]
Tonight I'm finna let you do the honors (Do the honors)
But you gotta bless your plate (Save you some for later, oh-oh)
No one else switch it up like that, I'm a challenge
I know how to claim my place (Place)

[Chorus: Ambré & Jvck James]
But I love it when you call me, "Baby"
Love it when you call me, "Baby"
Love it when you call me, "Baby"
Love it when you call me, "Baby"
Turn around, be submissive
Even though you know I talk big shit
And I peep shit, I'm attentive
I love it when you call me, "Baby"
I'm baby (Baby, baby, baby)
Love it when you call me, "Baby"
Love it when you call me, "Baby" (I love it when you call me)
Turn around, be submissive
I, I talk big shit
And I peep shit, I'm attentive
I love it when you call me, "Baby"
