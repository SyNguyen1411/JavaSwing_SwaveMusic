Umm...

Let's get comfortable
Me plus two
Back of the couple
You know what to do
Keep your hands on me
Pure ecstasy
Dirty sprite
Open doors
Just for you

I know you like her too
Just like I do
This point of view
Is something new for you

Ooh...
Girl, I don't really want to think this through
Just keep on doing what you're doing
Ooh...
Cause girl, I know you like how I do ya

The stars are aligned
What a hell of a night
I'm pulling her hair
I'm glad that you came
It's ok to share
Oh baby, you're something else
So don't be jealous of your own reflection
Baby, I know I know I know

You like her too
Just like I do
This point of view
Is something new
I know you like her too
Just like I do
This point of view
Is something new for you

Ooh...
Girl, I don't really want to think this through
Just keep on doing what you're doing
Ooh...
Cause girl, I know you like how I do ya

Ooh... yea, yea, yea...
I know you like it, baby
Like I do
Just like I do
Like I do
Just like I do
Like I do just know no do this for you
