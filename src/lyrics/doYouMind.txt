Another one
We The Best Music!
Yo, he ain't messing with no average chick, pop, pop
He got Nicki, he know that he hit the jackpot
Every baller tryna score, check them shot clocks
But I hit 'em with them 'Bron/Iguodala blocks
Eat the cake and he suck on my toes, yes
Hitting them home runs, I'll be like "go Mets!"
I want a dude that'll still kiss me when he mad
Type to cop me diamonds, he can miss me with them bags
Girl we been right here, thinkin' 'bout it all night
Baby you should be up in my bed
Do you mind, do you mind? (DJ Khaled)
Baby you, do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind?

And do you mind if I touch you there?
Girl, you know you can't do no better, baby
I know that it don't get no better than me
Let's not waste the time
You ain't gotta hold back cause I get inside
You won't change your mind, you know that you can take it
No need to hesitate, I need it, impatient
I'm not used to waiting, I want you to give it to me
Come on let me taste it until I get in love
Hope you're ready cause I'mma beat it up
Do you mind when I'mma have it? Know how to heat it up
I should, I should be the one, baby, you gon' love that
Girl, I know your body, know where every curve at
We been going all night, 'til the early
No you, no you wanna take off when you on my runway
We ain't gotta talk 'bout his conversation
Baby, by the way I touch you you know what I'm saying
Oh, oh, oh, ride it slow
Oh, oh, oh
I'm just tryna get to know ya

I'mma do that favor, drippin' flavor in you two piece
I'm gonna keep my promise, never treat you like a groupie
Calamari dinners, got you eatin' raw sushi
Still in the trap, but I like my bitches bougie
Two cups of styrofoam, excuse me lil' mama
I can hold you down, be your friend and your lover
You want watches, new Versaces, you want CÃ©line
Top back, screamin' money ain't a ting
Seeing two G-wagons in my driveway
FaceTime, two black bottles by my fireplace
Fell out with your peoples so you took the pictures down
Instagram ain't been the same since you so distant now
Took you shopping in other places that I won't name
First time your friends really got the see Balmain
20 million cash, seen it there with my two eyes
We the best and I told you this back in '05, (Maybach Music)
I'm just tryna get to know ya

Girl we been right here, thinkin' 'bout it all night
Baby you should be up in my bed
Do you mind, do you mind?
Baby you, do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind?
Oh, just in case you need me, I don't mind
Yo, tell them what to do, tell them what to do, tell them what to do
When you see a bad bitch in front of you, baby
Yeah, assume the position
I'm just tryna get to know ya
Get a little closer, maybe post up
Do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind?
Do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind?
Girl we been right here, thinkin' 'bout it all night
Baby you should be up in my bed
Do you mind, do you mind?
Baby you, do you mind? Do you mind? Do you mind?
