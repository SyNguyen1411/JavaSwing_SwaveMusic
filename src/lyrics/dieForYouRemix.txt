[The Weeknd:]
I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah

You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin', 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh

[The Weeknd (Ariana Grande):]
Even though we're goin' through it
(Aah, ah)
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you (Ooh, ooh)
Baby, I would die for you, yeah

The distance and the time between us
(The distance and the time)
It'll never change my mind
'Cause baby, I would die for you
(I would die for you)
Baby, I would die for you, yeah

[Ariana Grande:]
I'm finding ways to stay concentrated
On what I gotta do
Baby boy, it's so hard 'round you
And yes, I'm blaming you
And you know I can't fake it, now or never
And you insinuating that you think we might be better
Better me and you
Yeah, I know you do (Ooh, oh)

You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
It ain't workin', 'cause you're perfect
And I know you deserve it
I can't walk away

[The Weeknd (Ariana Grande):]
Even though we're goin' through it
(Even though)
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
(I would die for you)
Baby, I would die for you, yeah

The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind
'Cause baby, I would die for you, uh
(I would die for you)
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
(I would die for you)

[The Weeknd:]
I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby
I'm just sayin', yeah
I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na

[The Weeknd (Ariana Grande):]
Even though we're goin' through it
(Ooh, oh, boy)
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah

The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind
'Cause baby, I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
Oh, babe
