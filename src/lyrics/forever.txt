Oh, somebody
Oh, somebody
Oh, somebody
Oh, somebody
Passwords
That means you love me, I can give you what you ask for
Say you need a shooter, I can do it from the half-court
I can change your life up, painting murals on your passport (Louie)
Future kids all on the dashboard
Ooh
I like every flaw I see in you
This is all new
But I hope I got what you need too
(I hope I got what you need)
'Cause sometimes somebody loves somebody
But that body don't love 'em back
And it's easy to say that you didn't know
You didn't know what you had
But you don't, you're educated
You know that they don't make 'em
Like me anymore
So you pull me in close and say
Stay forever
(I think you should put your bag down, you should never leave)
Baby, you should stay forever
(I think you should put your bag down, you should never leave)
Baby, you should stay forever, ah-ah-ah-ah
Forever, ah-ah-ah
Forever, ah-ah-ah-ah
Forever, ah-ah-ah
Passwords, passports
I'ma have to treat you like a landlord
I want you to stay, save the moment
Gotta put it on the camcorder
She a all-star, pornstar
Throw it up and catch it off the backboard
I'ma give you everything that you ask for
Like you kick down the door on some task force shit
Credit card numbers
Four digit pin, social security
You could be happy, you should be happy
Long as you here with me
They could never get between us
Said we would never ever leave us
That was a while ago
That sometimes somebody loves somebody
But that body don't love 'em back
And it's easy to say that you didn't know
You ain't know what you had
But you don't, you're educated
You know that they don't make 'em
Like me anymore
So you pull me in close and say
Stay forever
(I think you should put your bag down, you should never leave)
Baby, you should stay forever
(I think you should put your bag down, you should never leave)
Baby, you should stay forever, ah-ah-ah-ah
Forever, ah-ah-ah
Forever, ah-ah-ah-ah
Forever, ah-ah-ah
