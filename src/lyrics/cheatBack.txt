I'm not gonna cry anymore
I'm not gonna wait up at night
I'm not gonna answer your calls
Whenever you're down
I'm not gonna bleach your clothes
I'm not gonna do you like that
What I really, really want
Is to cheat back (cheat back)
Find another boo from the hood with some tats
Give him what's yours, show him I can throw it back
Maybe then, baby, you'll know how to act, huh
(Cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat back)
If I cheat back (cheat back)
Send him new pics in that outfit you like
Say I'm with my girls while he spendin' the night
Maybe then, baby, you'll know how to act, huh
(Cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat back)
If I cheat back
Pullin' a you on you (you)
That's what I wanna do (Do)
Huh, I know you wouldn't like that (baby)
If I cheat back, huh
And I'ma ride it like a rodeo
He taught me some new tricks
I'll add that to my portfolio, yeah (yeah, yeah)
I might even make a video
And if you ever see it, you'd be sicker than polio
Damn (damn), 'cause cryin' ain't work for you (yeah, yeah)
Nothin' ain't work for you (yeah)
So the best thing for me to do
(As soon as you finish, might just start cryin', start cryin')
Don't you feel bad? (Yeah)
Don't you feel sad?
Let that sink in, real love, not revenge (love, not revenge)
Shorty finally found herself (cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat back)
Fuckin' on someone else
You're mad, girl, your heart still here
I could've spied and put cameras in the crib (you crazy)
I inspired you, it is what is is (cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat back)
That's my lil' twin I see
Tryna win I see, gettin' revenge, I see (righteous)
My twin I see, my lil' twin, I see
The beauty of you, that's what do it for me (what do it for me)
No one above you, girl, you the best (best)
Should've never let you down, feelin' embarrassed
Temptation hauntin' me like you've never imagined (you say that now)
Have some compassion, don't be so dramatic
I wanna know exactly what happened (baby, if I cheat back)
Find another boo from the hood with some tats (I wanna know)
Give him what's yours, show him I can throw it back
Maybe then, baby, you'll know how to act, huh
(Cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat back) If I cheat back (cheat back)
Send him new pics in that outfit you like (yeah)
Say I'm with my girls while he spendin' the night (yeah)
Maybe then, baby, you'll know how to act
If I cheat back (cheat back)
I was never good enough for you
You say you don't believe in monogamy
The games you play, Monopoly
You lie too much, you're tryin' me
The dick was good, it blinded me
You can fuck another girl, she'll never be a half of me
See my eyes, I turn around, you ain't 'bout to make me shout
I'ma call the homie, he gon' bend me for another round
Baby, pour another round, callin' for another round
I'ma drink you out my system, never lonely, I'ma cheat back
Find another boo from the hood with some tats
Give him what's yours, show him I can throw it back
Maybe then, baby, you'll know how to act, huh
(Cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat back) Oh, if I cheat back
Send him new pics in that outfit you like (yeah)
Say I'm with my girls while he spendin' the night
Baby, you'll know how to act
(Cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat back) If I cheat back
Ah, don't you feel better
Ah, not this again, make love, not revenge
Ah, yeah
Cheated on me, soon as you finish, might just start cryin'
