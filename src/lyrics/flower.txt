ABC 도레미만큼 착했던 나
그 눈빛이 싹 변했지
어쩌면 이 또한 나니까

난 파란 나비처럼 날아가
잡지 못한 건 다 네 몫이니까
활짝 꽃피웠던 시간도 이제 모두
내겐 lie lie lie

붉게 타버려진 너와 나
난 괜찮아 넌 괜찮을까
구름 한 점 없이 예쁜 날
꽃향기만 남기고 갔단다
꽃향기만 남기고 갔단다

You and me, 미칠 듯이 뜨거웠지만
처참하게 짓밟혀진 내 하나뿐인 라일락

난 하얀 꽃잎처럼 날아가
잡지 않은 것은 너니까
살랑살랑 부는 바람에 이끌려
봄은 오지만 우린 bye bye bye

붉게 타버려진 너와 나
난 괜찮아 넌 괜찮을까
구름 한 점 없이 예쁜 날
꽃향기만 남기고 갔단다
꽃향기만 남기고 갔단다

이젠 안녕 goodbye
뒤는 절대 안 봐
미련이란 이름의 잎새 하나
봄비에 너에게서 떨어져
꽃향기만 남아

꽃향기만 남기고 갔단다

ABC Do-Re-Mi I was as nice as that
That look in the eye changed completely
Perhaps this is also a side of me

I fly away like a blue butterfly
It's all on you that you didn't hold on
Even the times that we were in full bloom
A lie lie lie to me

Crimsonly burned down you and I
I'm ok would you be as well
On a beautiful day without a single cloud
There was nothing left but a scent of a flower
There was nothing left but a scent of a flower

You and me, although we were madly in love
Cruelly trampled, my one and only lilac

I fly away like a white petal
It's all on you that you didn't hold on
Drawn by a gentle wind
Spring comes but we say bye bye bye

Crimsonly burned down you and I
I'm ok would you be as well
On a beautiful day without a single cloud
There was nothing left but a scent of a flower
There was nothing left but a scent of a flower

Now goodbye goodbye
Never looking back
A leaf named hesitance
Falling away from you by a spring shower
Nothing left but a scent of a flower

There was nothing left but a scent of a flower
