I say that I don't miss you but I do
Say that I don't care, that's not the truth
Ignore my intuition once again
All for me to say you're still my friend
Seems like everybody knows but me
Didn't even know you moved right up the street
All the things you said we wouldn't be (Be, be, be)

So be it
It's been a hard time adjusting, so be it
Instead of letting me know, you kept secrets
But if I cut you this deep, you'd be in pieces
If that's how you really feel then so be it
So be it, so be it
If that's who you are then so be it
So be it, so be it
So be It

That night when we linked up on the East side
Rolled one, never would've thought that'd be the last time
Tried to reassure you, Lord knows I tried
Is the distance the reason that I'm the bad guy?
Don't give a fuck how it's affecting me
Trying to keep up, I'm not your enemy
Making decisions off feelings, I can't make you see the way I do
All is for nothing, all I can say is

So be it
It's been a hard time adjusting, so be it
Instead of letting me know, you kept secrets
But if I cut you this deep, you'd be in pieces
You'd be in pieces

Even if I did
You would be the last up on that list
I still can't believe you did that shit
But in my heart I still want to forgive
Came to terms that we might never get
Back to what we used to be
Everything's still new to me
Won't be no love lost

So be it
It's been a hard time adjusting, so be it
Instead of letting me know, you kept secrets
But if I cut you this deep, you'd be in pieces
If that's how you really feel then so be it
So be it, so be it
If that's who you are then so be it
So be it, so be it
So be It
