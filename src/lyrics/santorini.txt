You were so young and chasing feelings
I was so unprepared
You wanted nothing more than being
The answer to my prayers
We said we'd go to Santorini
Breathing the Grecian air
But lately, baby, I've been thinking
We'll never make it there
You wanted more than just to see me
I love the way you'd stare
Just constellations on the ceiling
How you would wash your head
To Amsterdam or New York City
You didn't really care
But lately, baby, I've been thinking
We'll never make it there
Wanted to go to Santorini
Think you should be aware
That lately, baby, I've been thinking
We'll never make it there
'Cause lately, baby, I've been thinking
We'll never make it there
