I don't I don't smoke but I'll go outside with you
Baby it's kinda cold
You can hold me if you want to
No I'm not thinking straight now
I had a few drinks before
But I don't I don't mind now
Cause I am here with you
We keep meeting each other this way
I was just thinking about you today hmm
All my friends are dancing in the living room
You pulled out a cigarette and say let's be alone
I don't I don't smoke but I'll go outside with you
Baby it's kinda cold
You can hold me if you want to
No I'm not thinking straight now
I had a few drinks before
But I don't I don't mind now
Cause I am here with you
I am here with you oh
I am here with you oh
Hoo ooh hoo ooh
I know what you wanna do we'll make out and let our bodies speak
I'll light that cigarette for you
Promise me that you will keep this between us
Let's go let's go smoke
I will go outside with you
Nobody has to know
Just hold me I know you want to
No I'm not thinking straight now
I had a few drinks before
But I don't I don't mind now
Cause I am here with you
I am here with you oh (hoo ooh)
I am here with you oh (hoo ooh)
Hoo ooh hoo ooh
Let's go let's go (hoo ooh hoo ooh)
Cause I am here (let's go)
I am here with you (let's go)
Hoo (let's go)
Cause I am here with you
