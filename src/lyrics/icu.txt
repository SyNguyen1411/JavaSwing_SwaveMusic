Oh, ooh
(Welcome to the camp)
Oh, ooh
Oh, ooh
Mm, mm-mm-mm
Mm, yeah, yeah
Oh, ooh
Something 'bout your hands on my body
Feels better than any man I ever had
Something 'bout the way you just get me
I try not, don't 'cause I can't forget
You got a feeling, a soul, that I need in my life (yeah, yeah)
Oh, woah
And though we may grow, I don't know why we don't grow apart
Maybe I-I-I-I-I, I need you
I breathe you, turnin' my heart blue, ooh, ooh
Maybe I-I-I-I-I, I need you
When I leave you, I see you, oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
First we agreed that we better as friends
I'll delete every messagе that we send
Try to move on with somеbody less like you
I don't know how we end up in the red
Find myself readin' your comments again
And then we end up in each other's heads
It all makes sense because
You've got a feeling, a soul, that I need in my life, babe
Oh, oh, oh-ooh-woah
And though we may grow, I don't know why we don't grow apart, babe
Baby
Maybe I-I-I-I-I, I need you
I breathe you, turnin' my heart blue, ooh, ooh
Maybe I-I-I-I-I, I need you
When I leave you, I see you, oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Maybe I just feel lost without you
Maybe I'm just pissed off without you
Maybe my life's just off without you
Maybe you're worth it all to me, baby
Maybe, maybe, just maybe
