Slow dancing in this burning house
I don't wanna go nowhere
It's hard for me to listen
When there's miles and miles of distance
Feel your heart is drifting but you're right there
I call you home but I might be alone
I can hear it in your tone
We're in the danger zone, in the danger zone, yeah
Way past the breaking point
'Cause I can't turn down the noise
You are my only choice
And we're both just filling voids
Way past the breaking point
'Cause I can't turn down the noise
You are my only choice
We're both just filling voids
Breaking point
Breaking point, oh-ooh
They told me love was fragile
They told me love was breakable
I thought that I could handle
But that is still debatable
I thought that this was for me
But it's feeling impossible
Breaking point, breaking point
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Breaking point, breaking point (ooh)
Thoughts running through my head
How bad can it get?
No, I'm not the type of man
To run off on a bet
Showed my full hand
Rip my plans for you
What am I going through?
What are we going through?
Our love is my only proof
That this is what I'm supposed to do
They told me love was fragile
They told me love was breakable
I thought that I could handle
But that is still debatable
I thought that this was for me
But it's feeling impossible
Breaking point, breaking point
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Breaking point, breaking point
Ooh, ooh-oh
Breaking point, breaking point
Breaking point, breaking point
Ooh-whoa, ooh
