Said, "Patience ain't no virtue with you"
I done wasted plenty time pacin' around, hate this coupe
You had bitches on the side and let my mind wonder too
You relentless, nigga, I don't need rent, nigga
Text me like I'm waitin' for you to come lie to me
Ruin my day, sayin' shit to hurt me, I can't compete
Still on the way, I lay awake if you're not around me
I'm so on to you, still gone for you
Needin' you to talk to me in your love language
Show me, yeah, how to connect to you
Help me understand
How you speak your love language
Bad as I wanna be yours, I can't get with your program
Sexin' like a slow jam, stick around 'cause I want to
Bad as I wanna keep focus, you remind me I'm imperfect
And it sucks to admit
Nobody put that purpose in me like you do, still
Nobody get that work up out me like you do
Nobody get the truth about me quite like you
You the definition of my right hand
Never mind ridin' backseat when you lead me
Talk to me in your love language
Show me, yeah, how to connect to you
Help me understand
How you speak your love language
Call me like you can't suppress memories of me
Call me like you got confessions queued up
Like your last bitch, lookin' chewed up, baby
Call me like you don't regret missin' this old thing back
Call me
You know the difference between me and chickens
You don't wanna be, be without me
You don't wanna live
I don't wanna go, ooh, no
I don't wanna be alone, oh
All that I know is mirrors inside me
They recognize you, please don't deny me
