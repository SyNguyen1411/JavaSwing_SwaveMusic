Mm hmm
Alone tonight
I'm alone tonight, I'm on demon time
And you're on my mind
Got an attitude but you still came through
'Cause you know it's fire
And I blow your mind when I'm on the mic
I'm your prototype yeah
Don't fight what you feelin', babe
No need for you to hesitate
It's taboo the things you make me say
I'm no psychic but I know what you need
Sex game is criminal
Take me like mental notes
Make me overflow
And wake me if the sheets gets cold
So many positions, so many decisions, yeah
I know I been distant
So touch me like you missed it, yeah
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh, oh
Love it when I'm drippin' on you
Grabbin' on my neck
Watchin' you, watchin' me
I'm the best you ever had
Admit it, the way I make you feel
Is why you're trippin'
Never had a girl so gifted
All natural with no gimmicks
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, no
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, no no
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, no
Oh, oh-oh
Ooh-oh, yeah
Sex game is criminal
Take me like mental note
Make me overflow
And wake me if the sheets gets gold
Sex game is criminal
Take me like mental notes
Ooh, oh, oh
(Love it when I'm drippin' on you)
(Grabbin' on my neck)
(Watchin' you, watchin' me)
(I'm the best you ever had)
Oh, ooh, ah ah, ooh oh, almost there
(Love it when I'm drippin' on you)
(Grabbin' on my neck) hey, yeah
(Watchin' you, watchin' me)
(I'm the best you ever had)
Almost, almost, almost there
Almost, almost there, almost there
He, he
He keeps getting his license suspended, like
He never got no gas
He always askin' for ten dollars for gas
He's always, he never puts up for weed (gas, gas is five dollars)
He never puts up for weed most of the time
He's a good time
He's funny
The dick is good, the sex is good, it's good
It's, it'll do
The sex is bomb, it's good, it'll do
It'll work, you, you need it, it-it works
